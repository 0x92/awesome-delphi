# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Please remember that only **open-source units/components** and **freeware tools** are considered. No commercial projects allowed! Dead projects are mainly ignored except for those which do not have alive analogs.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure your suggestion is useful before submitting. That implies it having enough content and every item a good succinct description.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[Title](link). Short author description`
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## General Libraries
*Big general-purpose libraries*

* [JVCL](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jvc) - library of over 600 Delphi components developed by "Project JEDI" members.
// *GUI, algorithms, classes etc.*

* [Alcinoe](http://sourceforge.net/projects/alcinoe) - Compoments suite for Delphi.
// *Network: FTP/Http/NNTP/POP3/SMTP Client, DB: Firebird/MySQL/SQLite3/Memcached/MongoDb client, Xml/Json Parser, Other: encryption, Self-Balancing Binary Trees*

## Multimedia
*Audio, video, graphic*

* [Audio Tools Library](http://mac.sourceforge.net/atl) - for manipulating with many audio formats file information. Abandoned since 2005.

* [New Audio Components (NewAC)](http://code.google.com/p/newac) designed to help your Delphi programs perform different sound processing tasks. With NewAC you can play audio stored in many formats (wav, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Monkey Audio, WavPack, MP3, Windows WMA, DTS, AC-3 (Dobly Surround), VOB (DVD files)).
// *Playback, recording, tag read/write, some audio editing tasks and conversions*

* [Graphics32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/graphics32) designed for fast 32-bit graphics handling on Delphi, Kylix and Lazarus. Optimized for 32-bit pixel formats, it provides fast operations with pixels and graphic primitives, and in most cases Graphics32 outperforms the standard TCanvas classes. It is almost a hundred times faster in per-pixel access and about 2â€“5 times faster in drawing lines.

* [GraphicEx](http://www.delphi-gems.com/index.php/libs/graphicex-library) is an addendum to Delphi's Graphics.pas to enable your application to load many common image formats. This library is primarily designed to load images as background (buttons, forms, toolbars) and textures (DirectX, OpenGL) or for image browsing and editing purposes as long as you don't need to save images.

* [Vampyre Imaging Library](http://imaginglib.sourceforge.net) - cross-platform native Object Pascal (Delphi and Free Pascal) image loading, saving, and manipulation library.

* [CCR-EXIF](http://ccr-exif.googlecode.com) - library to read and write Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata from JPEG, TIFF and PSD images.

## Network
*Socket communication, network protocols, encodings, etc*

* [Internet Component Suite](http://www.overbyte.be/frame_index.html) - asynchronous-based library composed of various Internet components and applications. Clients/servers for TCP, UDP, raw sockets, FTP, SMTP, POP3, NNTP, HTTP, Telnet and more. Supports SSL and TLS with the help of OpenSSL. Also includes Mime Decoder, SHA1/MD4/MD5 hashes, DES encryption.

## GUI
*Visual components*

* [EasyListView](http://code.google.com/p/mustangpeakeasylistview) - Part of VirtualShellTools for the Listview but can be used for a TListview Replacement that is faster and more customizable.
// *Feature-rich Listview capable with virtual (callback-based) MVC paradigm.*

* [VirtualTreeView](http://code.google.com/p/virtual-treeview) - treeview control built from ground up. Many years of development made it one of the most flexible and advanced tree controls available today.
// *Extremely flexible visual component implementing virtual (callback-based) MVC paradigm. Could be also used as a listview or grid.*

* [HtmlViewer](http://github.com/BerndGabriel/HtmlViewer) - The well-known Delphi/Lazarus HtmlViewer/FrameViewer.
// *Html visualiser supporting majority of tags, inline styles and CSS.*

* [Cindy components](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcycomponents) - Packages with 71 components: VCL controls (labels, buttons, panels, Edits, TabControls, StaticText) with features like background gradient, colored bevels, wallpaper, shadowText, caption orientation etc...

* [Delphi Chromium Embedded](https://code.google.com/p/delphichromiumembedded) - Embedding Chromium in Delphi, tested on Delphi 2010, XE, XE2, Delphi 7.

## Database

* [ZeosLib](http://sourceforge.net/projects/zeoslib) - set of database components for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Interbase, Firebird, MS SQL, Sybase, Oracle and SQLite.

## Non-visual Classes/Utils

* [TRegExpr](http://regexpstudio.com/TRegExpr/TRegExpr.html) - Easy to use and powerful tool for sophisticated search and substitutioning and for template-based text input check.

## Other

* [FastMM](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fastmm) - is a lightning fast replacement memory manager for Embarcadero Delphi Win32 and Win64 applications that is not prone to memory fragmentation, and supports shared memory without the use of external .DLL files.

* [Pascal Script](https://github.com/remobjects/pascalscript) - Pascal Script is a free scripting engine that allows you to use most of the Object Pascal language within your Delphi or Free Pascal projects at runtime. Written completely in Delphi, it is composed of a set of units that can be compiled into your executable, eliminating the need to distribute any external files. Pascal Script started out as a need for a good working script, when there were none available at the time.
